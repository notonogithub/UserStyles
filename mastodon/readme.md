For light theme, you may need to include `@import 'modern/light';`

If you know of more specific instructions for installing the theme, please let me know! As I've never been able to host a Mastodon instance before. 

An example of how it's done can be seen for mastodon.coffee: https://github.com/mstdn/Coffee/tree/main/app/javascript/styles
